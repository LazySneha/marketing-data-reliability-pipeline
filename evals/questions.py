"""
Eval questions with answers computed independently in SQL.

Each `expect_sql` returns one row; every value in it must appear in the agent's answer
(within TOLERANCE). The SQL runs at eval time, so the answers stay correct after a --demo rebuild.

The data ends Saturday 2026-08-29, so "last week" is Mon 2026-08-17 to Sun 2026-08-23.

Several questions have a plausible wrong answer next to the right one. The `trap` field says
what it is, so a failure can be read at a glance.
